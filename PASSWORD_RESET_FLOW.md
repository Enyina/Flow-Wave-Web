# Password Reset Flow - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Integrated Features

### Frontend Components (React)
1. **ForgotPassword** (`/forgot-password`)
   - Email input field
   - "Get OTP" button
   - Validation for email format
   - Routes to OTP entry on success

2. **EnterOTP** (`/enter-otp`)
   - 4-digit OTP input boxes
   - Auto-focus and auto-advance between inputs
   - Countdown timer (4:16 minutes)
   - Resend OTP functionality when timer expires
   - Routes to reset password on successful verification

3. **ResetPassword** (`/reset-password`)
   - New password input with validation
   - Confirm password input with matching validation
   - Password strength requirements enforced
   - Routes to login on successful reset

### Backend Endpoints (Express)
1. **POST `/api/auth/forgot-password`**
   - Generates 4-digit OTP
   - Stores OTP in user record with 5-minute expiry
   - Returns success (OTP logged to console for testing)

2. **POST `/api/auth/verify-otp`**
   - Verifies OTP against stored value
   - Checks expiry time
   - Generates reset token on success (15-minute validity)
   - Clears OTP from user record

3. **POST `/api/auth/reset-password`**
   - Validates reset token
   - Updates user password
   - Marks token as used

### Database Schema Updates
Added to User model:
- `resetOtp` (String?) - Stores the 4-digit OTP
- `resetOtpExpiry` (DateTime?) - OTP expiration timestamp
- `pinHash` (String?) - For PIN creation feature

PasswordResetToken model added for token-based verification after OTP.

```
User forgets password
    ↓
Enter email → Send OTP
    ↓
Receive OTP (4 digits)
    ↓
Enter OTP → Verify
    ↓
Enter new password

Password reset successful → Login
```

## 🎨 Design Implementation

All components follow the Figma design specifications:
- **Colors**: Primary Blue (#3A49A4), Primary Pink (#E830B0)
- **Typography**: Inter font family, responsive sizing
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions, slide-in effects, scale animations
- **Dark Mode**: Full support with proper color schemes
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop

## 🧪 Testing the Flow

### Step 1: Start the backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Trigger forgot password
1. Navigate to `/login`
2. Click "Reset Password?"
3. Enter your email
4. Click "Get OTP"

### Step 3: Check console for OTP
The OTP will be logged in the backend console (in production, this would be sent via email):
```
OTP for user@example.com: 1234
```

### Step 4: Enter OTP
1. Enter the 4-digit OTP from console
2. Click "Verify"

### Step 5: Reset password
1. Enter new password (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)
2. Confirm password
3. Click "Reset Password"

### Step 6: Login with new password
You'll be redirected to login with a success message.

## ⚠️ Not Implemented (Production Requirements)

1. **Email Service Integration**
   - Currently OTP is logged to console
   - Production needs: SendGrid, AWS SES, or similar
   - Add to `forgotPassword` controller

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Should limit OTP requests per email
   - Prevent abuse/spam

3. **OTP Attempt Limits**
   - Track failed OTP verification attempts
   - Lock account after X failed attempts

## 📋 Database Migration Required

Run this command to update your database schema:
```bash
cd backend
npm run migrate
```

Or with Prisma:
```bash
npx prisma db push
```
